    "You are being assessed based on:\n",
    "- Code execution - 25%\n",
    "- Clarity of the code (e.g., easy to follow, has pertinent comments, etc.) - 25%\n",
    "- Proper usage of the techniques seen in class - 25%\n",
    "- Quality and correcteness of the results - 25%\n",

    "## Option 01: Building a Classification Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to build a classification model to distinguish between male/female classes or siemens/ge/philips scanners (choose one or propose a new dataset that is of more interest to you).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the classification model, you should employ 5-fold cross-validation. The data split and the data is provided to you at the following folder: \"ENEL645/Data/Assignment03-classification-model\" or you can download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13gcCJC6H4ZtmVtPiXqIdHYC8jadF6Aug?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "The deliverables for this assignment option are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code\n",
    "- Accuracy results (mean +/- standard-deviation)\n",
    "- Feature importance analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to choose the model you deem the most appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Option 02: Implementing a domain adaptation method for an image classification problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is for you to design an image classification model trained using mnist_data and tested using mnistm_data and compare the results of the model in two scenarios: 1. with no domain adaptation strategy or 2. employing an unsupervised domain adaptation strategy. The data is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rql7WguiVMO8AaGdMgvXeJneSa1QO0Sm?usp=sharing)\n",
    "\n",
    "The deliverables for this assignment option are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code\n",
    "- Accuracy results  for the source domain data and the target domain data with and without a domain adaptation strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggestion is that you implement the following domain adaptation method:\n",
